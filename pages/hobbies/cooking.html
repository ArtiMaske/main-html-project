    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>
      Food is something that nobody can live without. Wherever you may be, you
      may engage yourself in cooking. People who look to cook say that they
      forget all their worries when they are on it. The kind of satisfaction
      people get from preparation to perfection is immense.It isn't something
      that must be done to the exclusion of other things. You can listen to
      music and dance around your kitchen as you prepare dinner. You can spend
      quality time with others while cooking, too.
