    <h2>Dancing</h2>
    <p>
      Dancing is a hobby that is experienced in leisure, but it is an effective
      form of sports that frames a healthy mind and body. Dancing is a boon for
      our body, too, as it strengthens and tones up all the muscles of our body
      and releases the dopamine hormone in our body, which makes it happy,
      joyful, and active.
